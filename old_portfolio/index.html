                                        this was my first time working with others in an official team setting using proper software development practices.

                                        the collaboration went incredibly well according to agile development, i was able to receive blueprints on time from the designer and learn a lot from more experienced engineers during pair programming sessions
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        it ended up winning 3rd place out of 30 teams. it wasn't the best finish, but given how a lot of us were beginners, i'm very proud of both the end result and the development process.

                                        this was the first project that i attempted by myself when i first started learning web dev, and is my personal favorite one lol (by a long shot). i started my first draft before i even knew what a flexbox was.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        my two favorite features are the radar chart using chart.js and the 3d carousel animation. i think radar charts are a very cool way of presenting different stats, but had to take a step back when i learned that there's no native way to implement it using simple CSS. chart.js was the first external package that i learned (first of many) and i'm very proud of the result.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        the first 3 drafts all layed all the cards flat out on the side, or were implemented as collapsibles. but one day when i was browsing youtube, i came across this 3d carousel animation and was blown away by how cool it was, so i felt like i had to implemented it, which i agree is not the best practice when making a product lol. but hey, i'm just learning and playing around here, so why not. it turns out that the 3d carousel alerted the user when the set is changed or has reloaded and let them know that there's other cards to choose from before they see the menu on the side, so it ended up making the product more discoverable
                                    </p>
